Common
======

Common utilities for C and Obj-C. This is mostly for my own internal use, so there may be some odd conventions, missing features in some things, etc.

This project is the result of me re-organzing all of my common utilities, as well as re-writing a few of them, and finally not being lazy and writing tests for them. At the moment only a few things have been moved into it, and it will be updated more and more as I go along. I may also include my common graphics utilities too, or they may be placed into a separate repository.

The majority of this stuff at the moment is for simplicity and portability, many of these utilities have optimized alternatives I've written but I'm not sure if I'll add them to the project or not as they're very target specific.
